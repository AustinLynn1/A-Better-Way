# A-Better-Way

A Better Way project is a project created by A Better Way Athletics for Professor Hare’s Senior Capstone class Fall 2019. The goal of this project is for a group of students to use scrum agile methodology to develop a real world application skeleton for A Better Way Athletics. The goal of this application is to for it to be sold to Universities, Athletic organizations, and athletic coaches in general. This application will provide A Better Way Athletic’s C.O.R.E model ideology in a condensed mobile, and app form. Transactional coaching has a major focus on immediate technical and competitive performance of athletes. This application will help enable coaches to make the swap to being transformational coaches. Current coaching developments only temporarily help coaches be transformational coaches but often they fall back into transactional habits. Leveraging technology as well as support from A Better Way Athletics this application should enable coaches to make a habit of transformational coaching. This software shall act as as skeleton for the final product that A Better Way Athletics plans to eventually sell to the public.
